  |   Juicy Realm is a roguelite game in which players must square off      |
  |   against bizarre fruits all across the world. The line between the     |
  |   animal and the plant world has become blurred, and the food chain     |
  |   has been completely disrupted. Humans, upon making this incredible    |
  |   discovery, have set up outposts along the border of the aggressive    |
  |   plants' habitat for investigations, defense, and in preparation for   |
  |   what may come. You take the role of a soldier on the front lines      |
  |   charged with confronting this strange new enemy.                      |
  |                                                                         |
  |   "Many years in the future, humanity looks upward in despair at        |
  |   plants, now standing atop the food chain. How could they have been    |
  |   so arrogant..".                                                       |
  |                                                                         |
  |   Only when plants began sprouting arms and legs and developing         |
  |   self-awareness did humanity truly begin to understand the menace      |
  |   that these once photosynthesis-dependent creatures posed. No one      |
  |   could understand how the plants took this large evolutionary leap     |
  |   in such a short time, something that took their animal counterparts   |
  |   millions of years to accomplish. One thing is certain, now is the     |
  |   time for humanity to make their stand in order to stay at the top     |
  |   of the food chain.                                                    |
  |                                                                         |
  |   As one of the first explorers of the newly discovered plant empire,   |
  |   you must continuously drive deeper and deeper into the enemy's        |
  |   lair. Defeat bizarre and colorful fruits while retrieving new gear,   |
  |   weapons, and resources to defend yourself and expand your base        |
  |   camp.                                                                 |
  |                                                                         |
  |   If you're unable to defeat the overwhelming destructive force of      |
  |   the plant army alone, invite a few friends to lend a hand and help    |
  |   you discover the secrets behind this strange new world.               |
  |                                                                         |
